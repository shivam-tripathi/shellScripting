The shell provides an interface to the UNIX system.
In UNIX, there are two major types of shells :
	The Bourne type shell - prompt is $
		Bourne shell (sh)
		Korn shell (ksh)
		Bourne Again shell (bash)
		POSIX shell (sh)
	The C type shell - prompt is %
		C shell (csh)
		TENEX/TOPS C shell (tcsh)

The original UNIX shell was written by Stephen R. Bourne in mid 1970s at AT & T
Bell labs in New Jersey.

The bourne shell is installed as /bin/sh on most versions of UNIX.

Shell scripts are interpreted. They have .sh extention.
The shebang construct : The beginning of any shell script must have the shebang
construct to alert the system about shell script beginning. The shebang
construct is :
#!/bin/sh
Next make the file executable :
chmod +x filename.sh
Then execute the file :
./filename.sh

Linux can run the scripts without the shebang construct. Also no need to make
the script executable. Just type :
bash filename.sh
